# Bloom Filter Visualizer

An interactive, educational web app that demonstrates how Bloom Filters work using Python, Dash, Plotly, and PyTorch.

This tool lets you add or test elements, view live updates to a bit array, and observe real-time stats like fill ratio and estimated false positive rate. Ideal for learning, teaching, and exploring probabilistic data structures.

## Features

- Add and test items in a Bloom Filter
- Visual heatmap of the bit array
- Real-time stats:
  - Bits set
  - Fill ratio
  - False positive rate
- Multiple hash functions
- Clean, responsive web UI (Dash + Bootstrap)
